/*(b) Write a static method rowSums that calculates the sums of each of the rows in a given 
 * two- dimensional array and returns these sums in a one-dimensional array. The method has one 
 * parameter, a two- dimensional array arr2D of int values. The array is in row-major order: 
 * arr2D[r][c] is the entry at row r and column c. The method returns a one-dimensional array with
 *  one entry for each row of arr2D such that each entry is the sum of the corresponding row in arr2D. 
 *  As a reminder, each row of a two-dimensional array is a one-dimensional array. 
For example, if mat1 is the array represented by the following table, the call rowSums(mat1) 
returns the array {16, 32, 28, 20}. */
